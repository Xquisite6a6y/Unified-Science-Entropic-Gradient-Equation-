This repository documents a new cosmological model, its formal mathematical framework, and a blueprint for its experimental validation. This work proposes a paradigm shift from traditional physics, suggesting that the laws of the universe are not fundamental, but emerge naturally from a single principle: the possibility of Difference.

This work was previously submitted to the Open Science Framework (OSF) and was declined not for being flawed, but for being too novel for their existing experts to review. This repository serves as the definitive, public record of this theory.

## The Core Claim

The universe emerged from an information-based entropy gradient created by the possibility of Difference. To measure the cascading levels of complexity (chaos) produced by this initial event, the universe spontaneously generated dimensions, each one a necessary tool to quantify a new level of complexity. Reality, as we know it, is the ongoing process of the universe measuring itself.

## Key Documents

*   **[The Theory](./The_Theory.md):** A conceptual overview of the Emergent Universe framework, including the Genesis Cascade and the Dimensional Ladder.
*   **[The Mathematical Framework](./The_Mathematical_Framework.md):** The formal differential equations that govern the dynamics of this cosmology.
*   **[Research Program and Blueprint](./Research_Program_and_Blueprint.md):** A detailed analysis of the theory, its validation against real-world data (PREM), and a comprehensive blueprint for a numerical simulation to prove its principles.

## Evidence and Proofs

This repository is structured to provide a complete, end-to-end validation of the theory.

*   **/proofs/:** Contains experimental data, including results from Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) experiments that show the physical reality of the core constants derived in the theory.
*   **/simulation/:** Contains the source code for a numerical simulation built according to the principles outlined in the blueprint. This simulation does not assume any laws of physics, but allows them to emerge naturally from the interaction of
